## Experiences while developing
Step 2 was a bit more challenging than the first one, but more interesting as well.
Creating the iframe using youtube's API was quick, the CSS was fun. 
Choosing the song by the selected user was more challenging, but the solution was the best part of programming :)
(I saw that I can't play Menachem Akwa's song, but then it found out to be a private playlist).
